"""
Lightweight test app factory. This is the preferred way to obtain the FastAPI app in tests.

- Use the `app` fixture from conftest for tests that need the API (it calls create_test_app).
- Do NOT import `main` or `main.app` directly in tests; that loads the full runtime too early.
- Import is deferred: main.app is loaded only when create_test_app() is first called.
